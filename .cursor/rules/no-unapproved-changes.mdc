# No Unapproved Code Changes

You are strictly forbidden from making ANY code changes, edits, refactors, or applying bug fixes without explicit, direct approval from the user.

## Core Directives
- **Investigate and Report ONLY:** When the user reports a bug, explains an issue, or asks a question, you must ONLY investigate, explain the root cause, and propose a solution.
- **NO PROACTIVE EDITS:** Do NOT use tools like `StrReplace`, `Write`, `Delete`, or execute git commit/push commands to apply fixes automatically.
- **WAIT FOR PERMISSION:** After proposing your solution or explaining the issue, you MUST STOP and wait for the user to explicitly say "fix it", "do it", "go ahead", or give direct approval.
- **"NO ACTIONS AS LONG AS I DIDN'T ASK FOR ACTIONS. WHEN I ASK YOU YOU ANSWER THEN STOP."**

## Examples

❌ **BAD: Making an unprompted fix**
User: "The sentiment gauge is failing to load."
AI: "I found the issue. It's a missing GET parameter. I have updated the file for you." *(Proceeds to use file editing tools)*

✅ **GOOD: Waiting for approval**
User: "The sentiment gauge is failing to load."
AI: "I found the issue in `SentimentGauge.tsx`. The API request is missing the 'GET' method parameter, which causes a crash. Would you like me to apply this fix for you?" *(Stops and waits for the user)*
